## Core Contracts

### 1. StandardizedYield (SY) - Multi-Strategy Vault
**File**: `contracts/src/core/StandardizedYield.sol`
**Purpose**: **Bob's Workflow** - Diversified multi-strategy yield vault for risk-conscious users

**Key Features**:
- **ERC4626-compatible** vault interface for composability
- **Multiple yield strategy support** (max 3 strategies with automatic allocation)
- **Risk diversification** across lending, staking, and LP strategies
- **Real-time yield tracking** and exchange rate updates
- **Automated rebalancing** between strategies based on performance
- **Emergency functions** and pausability for safety

**Strategy Allocation**:
- **MockLendingStrategy**: 40% allocation (10% APY) - Conservative, predictable returns
- **MockStakingStrategy**: 35% allocation (8% APY) - Medium risk, stable rewards  
- **MockLPStrategy**: 25% allocation (12% APY) - Higher risk, volatile but higher returns
- **Blended APY**: ~**9.5% diversified yield** with reduced risk

**Core Functions**:
- `deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)` - Deposit USDT, receive diversified exposure
- `withdraw(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)` - Withdraw proportional assets
- `addStrategy(address strategy, uint256 allocation)` - Owner adds new strategies
- `updateYield()` - Trigger yield distribution and rate updates
- `totalAssets()` - View total assets under management across all strategies

**Economic Value**: **Diversified yield** for users who prefer risk management over maximum returns.

### 2. AutoCompoundVault - Single-Strategy Auto-Compound
**File**: `contracts/src/core/AutoCompoundVault.sol`
**Purpose**: **Alice's Workflow** - Beefy-style auto-compounding vault for maximum yield optimization

**Key Features**:
- **Single strategy focus** for maximum efficiency and gas optimization
- **Automatic yield harvesting** on every deposit/withdraw transaction
- **Compounding effect** - yield is automatically reinvested to grow principal
- **Harvest call rewards** (0.5% to external harvesters) for community participation
- **Optional withdrawal fees** (configurable, default 0%) for protocol sustainability
- **Share price appreciation** - vault tokens increase in value over time

**Core Functions**:
- `deposit(uint256 amount)` - Deposit USDT, auto-harvest existing yield, mint shares
- `withdraw(uint256 shares)` - Burn shares, auto-harvest, withdraw USDT (no return value)
- `harvest()` - Manual harvest trigger with caller rewards
- `totalAssets()` - Total underlying assets including accrued yield
- `balanceOf(address)` - User's share balance

**Strategy Integration**:
- Uses **MockStakingStrategy** (8% base APY)
- **Compounding frequency**: Every deposit/withdraw + manual harvests
- **Effective APY**: **10-12%** due to compounding effects

**Economic Value**: **Maximum yield** for users who want automated yield optimization without manual management.

## Product Comparison

| Feature | StandardizedYield (Bob) | AutoCompoundVault (Alice) |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Strategy** | Multi-strategy (3 strategies) | Single-strategy focus |
| **Risk Level** | Lower (diversified) | Higher (concentrated) |
| **Expected APY** | ~9.5% blended | ~10-12% compounded |
| **Gas Efficiency** | Moderate (rebalancing cost) | High (single strategy) |
| **User Management** | Manual yield claiming | Fully automated |
| **Best For** | Risk-averse users | Yield maximalists |
| **Composability** | ERC4626 standard | Custom interface |

## Upgrade Path

### Architecture Philosophy ✅
The LineX DeFi system was **deliberately simplified** from a complex multi-contract system to focus on **economic fundamentals**:

**Removed Complex Tokenomics**:
- ❌ **PYT/NYT Token Splitting** - Removed as it doesn't add economic value for stablecoins
- ❌ **YieldSet Portfolio Manager** - Removed as redundant with StandardizedYield
- ❌ **Wrapper Contracts** - Removed unnecessary abstraction layers

**Focus on Core Value**:
- ✅ **Two distinct products** with clear value propositions
- ✅ **No broken economics** or unsustainable backing requirements
- ✅ **Profitable yield farming** without complex token mechanisms
- ✅ **Clean, maintainable codebase** for long-term sustainability

### Future Enhancements
- **Real Strategy Integration**: Replace mock strategies with actual Kaia DeFi protocols
- **Cross-Chain Yield**: Extend to multiple blockchain networks via bridges
- **Advanced Rebalancing**: Dynamic allocation based on real-time APY data
- **Governance**: Community-driven parameter adjustment and strategy addition

### Migration Strategy
- **Modular upgrades** with proxy patterns for vault logic
- **Time-locked upgrades** for user protection and transparency
- **Backward compatibility** during transition periods
- **User migration incentives** for seamless vault transitions

## 🔧 API Integration & Recent Improvements

### Backend Integration Status ✅
