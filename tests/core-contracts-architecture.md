## 🔧 **Core Contract #3: PYTNYTOrchestrator**

### **Purpose**
An advanced yield derivatives system that splits yield-bearing positions into separate tradeable tokens: PYT (future yield rights) and NYT (principal protection), enabling sophisticated yield strategies.

### **Key Features**
- **Yield Splitting**: Separates principal from future yield

- **Risk Tolerance**: High
- **Goal**: Maximize returns through active yield management
- **Strategy**: "Trade yield like a professional"

**Alex's Journey:**
```
1. 💰 Deposits 100 USDT → SY Vault → Gets 100 SY shares
2. 🔀 Splits 100 SY shares → 100 PYT + 100 NYT tokens
3. 📊 Market Analysis:
   - Sells 100 NYT for 95 USDT (5% discount for giving up principal)
   - Keeps 100 PYT (all future yield rights)
   - Now has 195 USDT exposure to yield from 100 USDT investment
4. 💰 Claims yield regularly from PYT position
5. 🔄 Can buy back NYT later to recombine or hold PYT indefinitely
```

## 🎯 **Contract Interaction Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Conservative to Aggressive Progression**
```
Dave starts: SY Vault → Alex buys Dave's PYT → Sarah compounds the yield → Sophia orchestrates all
```

### **Scenario 2: Risk Transfer Market**
```
Multiple users create PYT/NYT positions → Secondary market develops → Yield trading economy emerges
```

### **Scenario 3: Institutional Management**
```
Sophia's YieldSet allocates across ALL contracts → Creates meta-diversification → Professional yields
```
