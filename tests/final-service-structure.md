# ✅ Final Clean Service Structure - 1:1 Contract Mapping

## Cleaned Up Service Architecture

### 🎯 4 Core Services (1:1 Contract Mapping)

```
CONTRACT                     →  SERVICE                    →  API ENDPOINT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
StandardizedYield            →  StandardizedYieldService   →  /api/v1/defi/vault/*
AutoCompoundVaultWrapper     →  AutoCompoundVaultService   →  /api/v1/defi/autocompound/*
PYTNYTOrchestrator          →  PYTNYTOrchestratorService  →  /api/v1/defi/split/* & /api/v1/defi/nyt/*
YieldSet                    →  YieldSetService            →  /api/v1/defi/yieldset/*
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Clean Structure

1. **No Service Overlap** - Each service has a single responsibility
2. **Clear Contract Mapping** - Easy to understand which service handles which contract
3. **Maintainable Code** - No duplicate functionality across services
4. **Predictable API** - Service name matches contract functionality
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Easy to add new contracts with corresponding services

This clean structure eliminates confusion and provides a clear, maintainable service layer for the LineX DeFi platform.
